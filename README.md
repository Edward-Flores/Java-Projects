Encryption Algorithms

subCipher.java: This code simulates a manual encryption process. When ran, it will prompt the user to enter their own encrypt for the alphabet. After each plaintext letter is encrypted, then it will ask the user to enter a plaintext, and it will output an ciphertext using your own encryption algorithm.

textDecryption.java: This code has a built in encryption algorithm, and when ran, the user can use the key mapping to write an encrypted message Uppercase letters are plain text, the lowercase letters are cipher text. The user will enter the cipher text to output their desired plaintext

textAnalysis.java: Developed a Java-based cryptanalysis tool to decrypt monoalphabetic substitution ciphers using statistical frequency analysis. Implemented character frequency counting, percentage-based analysis, and sorting algorithms to identify probable plaintext mappings. Applied real-world English letter frequency distributions to reconstruct encrypted messages. Preserved original text structure, punctuation, and letter casing during decryption. Demonstrated practical weaknesses of classical encryption methods and reinforced cryptographic security principles.
